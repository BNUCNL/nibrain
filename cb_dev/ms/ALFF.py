    caculate ALFF of HCPD resting state data
    three step:
        1. transform time series to a frequency domain with a fast Fourier transform (FFT).
        2. calculate square root at each frequency of the power spectrum and obtaine averaged square root across 0.01â€“0.08 Hz at each voxel. (individual ALFF value)
        3. For standardization purposes, the ALFF of each voxel was divided by the global mean ALFF value. (about 1)
